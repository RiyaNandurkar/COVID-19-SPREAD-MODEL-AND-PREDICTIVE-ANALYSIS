#	PROJECT NAME: COVID-19 SPREAD MODEL AND PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS

#PROJECT SUMMARY:
*	This numerical project dependent on different factors and investigations. Here, Iâ€™m presented a model that could be useful to predict the spread of COVID-2019 and state wise analysis in India.
*	With the common data about confirmed, death and recovered cases across India for over the time length helps in anticipating and estimating the not-so-distant future.
*	Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak.

#Details of project developed:
*	Machine learning is helping researchers and practitioners analyze large volumes of data to forecast the spread of COVID-19, in order to act as an early warning system for future pandemics and to identify vulnerable populations.
*	Modeling viral diseases such as Covid-19 is extremely important in determining their possible future impact. 
* In this project, Random Forest and Logistic Regression machine learning algorithms are used to predict the future cases with COVID-19. 
*	In this study, the most top confirmed cases states and top death cases states were also identified.
*	 Finally, I used a separate dataset of COVID-19 state wise analysis dataset to evaluate confirmed cases ratio and death cases ratio graphically.  
*	In the final step, training and testing of a dataset has performed and on the basis of date (which is converted into to-ordinal data) future cases are predicted.
